# Copilot Capabilities Matrix

This repo collects examples for GitHub Copilot agents and tooling in VS Code.
Use it as a quick reference for what agents can do and where to try it.

## Capabilities and where to try them

| Capability | Where | Try it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Custom agents | .github/agents | Switch agents in the Chat view and compare behavior |
| Agent handoffs | .github/agents | Use the handoff buttons after a response |
| Hooks and policy | .github/hooks | Try hooks in a VS Code Insiders session |
| Tool usage | docs/tools.md | Enable tools and test approvals |
| Planning and review | docs/workflows.md | Run the plan -> implement -> review flow |
| Research workflows | docs/workflows.md | Use the Researcher agent and hand off |

## Notes

- Hooks are in preview and require VS Code Insiders.
- Tool availability varies by VS Code version and installed extensions.
